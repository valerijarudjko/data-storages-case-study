# Data Storages: Event Organisation Company - Case Study

This project analyses an event organisation company responsible for managing a large-scale concert featuring six musical artists and groups in a venue of 20,000 attendees. It focuses on applying real-time data processing and monitoring systems to ensure artist logistics, VIP security, and smooth audience management. The case also examines the use of live traffic data, QR code entry, mobile monitoring, and surveillance systems to detect incidents and coordinate responses in real time. Objectives include improving decision-making, enhancing safety and customer experience, and increasing operational efficiency through streaming data and advanced event management strategies. Overall, the project highlights how data-driven solutions can support complex event logistics and reduce risks during large gatherings.

## Event4u Company: Background

An event organization company is tasked with organizing a major concert featuring six musical artists and groups. The venue can accommodate 20,000 people, and they expect to sell out all the tickets.

The company manages all logistics and aspects of the event, from picking up the artists at their hotels and transporting them to the venue, to attending to them before and after their performances. They are also responsible for setting up stages and fixed elements at the venue, such as bars and VIP areas, ensuring the event's security, and of course, managing the audience—from ticket sales and venue access via QR code to maintaining order within the venue.

The company has three main concerns: First is artist care, ensuring they arrive on time by considering each group's requests and the area's traffic conditions. It is crucial that artists spend the minimal necessary time at the venue—just enough for a brief pre-performance period, the duration of their act, and departure from the venue, while coordinating with the six groups.

Second, attention to the VIP area involves ensuring security, preventing unauthorized access, and continuously providing catering services.

Lastly, general audience management aims for smooth access to the venue, ensuring guests enjoy the event safely, have easy access to food areas, and do not enter unauthorized zones.

The technical aspects of the concert are of lesser concern since this element has been previously addressed and works correctly, though a small maintenance crew is kept on standby for any issues that might arise during the event.

The company divides its concerns into two scenarios: one already tested and checked, minimizing and controlling potential difficulties, and the other involving three aspects it cannot control beforehand and must respond to during the event.

Given the need to respond to potential issues on-site, the company decides to build a real-time database. Thanks to traffic services with live camera feeds of the main areas, they can detect incidents on roads. These records are processed in real-time and stored, which will help coordinate group entrances and exits.

Additionally, since venue access is through QR codes, attendees' mobile phones are monitored, enabling real-time incident detection and alerts to space managers. By accessing discussions on attendees' social media through app permissions, they can also detect real-time feedback and evaluate the concert's reception.

Lastly, the VIP area is monitored by security cameras to ensure the space is preserved and unauthorized access is prevented, providing constant surveillance to anticipate and address potential problems.

## To do:
1. Question

Do you think the data processing performed by the company is batch or streaming? Justify your answer.

2. Question 

Do you consider the data flow generated by attendees' mobile messages as structured?

3. Question 

Analyzed by Spark Streaming, what important information do you think this process can provide to the company?

4. Question

A potential problem with the public could be overcrowding in common areas such as restrooms or dining areas. In response, the company contacts sector managers automatically through a system that sends signals to the manager's tablet indicating where a problem is occurring and possible solutions. Do you think detecting these incidents is feasible? What system should detect them?

5. Question

What platform would be suitable for the company in managing data? What security measures should the company implement for data received from three sources: traffic security cameras, QR code scanners, and VIP area surveillance cameras? Do you think all three information transmission systems can be treated equally concerning their storage, security, and response protocols?
